The following recordings are real EEG signals extracted from a variety of patients with various indications utilising different recording schemes.
Some schemes you may come across in research are: ERPs, continous EEG, or schemes tailored toward specific EEG bands.

EEGs are usuaully analysed through the different montages used - ie. features may be selected based on the relation of one electrode to the other
electrodes around it. For instance differential recording is very common between two electrodes. You may come across this in your research.

For the purpose of this task however, you will only be using a single channel of data- ONE vector input, which you will the conduct signal processing on.

Each recording has multiple channels, so you can just pick one (or many) to test on.
Some notes: 
- The units for all recordings are already in uV
- fs is different for each recording
- channel names are given, just incase some of you decide to experiment on multiple channels.
